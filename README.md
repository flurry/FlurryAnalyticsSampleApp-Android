* Branch protection is required by Ministry of Code. Find more details at http://yo/moc-faq
* Automatic Branch Protection is provided by DPS SCM. Contact us at dpse@verizonmedia.com or Slack #github-support
* The admin account is managed by DPS SCM.  For more info, go [here](https://confluence.ouroath.com/display/SCM/Github+Enterprise+Administrative+User)
